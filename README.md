# Web-Scrapping-Python
In this repository, I have used a dummy website to scrape data. I have used Requests and BeautifulSoup for scraping.

# Scraping Rules:
- Check a website's Term and Conditions before scraping it and read the statements about legal use of the data.
- Do not request data from the website too aggressiely and ensure that your program behaves in a reasonable manner.
